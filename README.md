## Riya Dudeja

Aspiring Software Engineer focused on building clear, maintainable web systems, with attention to both user experience and backend correctness.

I work across frontend and backend layers, and I’m particularly interested in how small engineering decisions shape usability, performance, and system reliability.

---

### How I Build
- Break loosely defined problems into structured, testable features
- Design user-facing flows that are backed by simple, predictable APIs
- Prefer readable, maintainable code over clever abstractions
- Ship complete features rather than isolated components
